TARGET RESEARCH DIRECTION:
{{researchDirection}}

EVALUATION TASK:
Assess how well this professor's ACTUAL research matches the target direction.

CRITICAL CHECKS:
1. Do their papers DIRECTLY address the target topic? (Not just tangentially)
2. Are publications RECENT (2023-2025)? (Old work = lower score)
3. Is there DEPTH of work in this area? (1-2 papers = not expert)
4. Do paper titles/venues MATCH the research direction?

BE STRICT:
- If papers are in different subfield → Score <0.4
- If only 1-2 relevant papers → Score <0.6
- If no recent papers (2023+) → Score -0.1
- If areas list doesn't match → Score <0.5

PROVIDE:
Score: [Be conservative! Most should be 0.3-0.6]
Reasoning: [Cite specific papers or explain mismatch]
Research Summary: [Describe THEIR actual work, not the target]
