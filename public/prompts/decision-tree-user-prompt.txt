TASK 1: Answer YES/NO questions to evaluate research alignment.

QUESTION 1: Is the professor's PRIMARY research area directly related to the target direction?
- Answer YES if: The main research area explicitly matches or is central to the target
- Answer NO if: The main research area is different, though may have some overlap

[If Q1 = YES, continue to Q2]
QUESTION 2: Does the professor have RECENT publications (2024-2025) in this direction?
- Answer YES if: Has 2 or more papers in 2024-2025
- Answer NO if: Has 0-1 papers in 2024-2025, or only older papers

[If Q2 = YES, continue to Q3]
QUESTION 3: Is the research HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE in this area?
- Answer YES if: Has 5+ papers total in 2023-2025
- Answer NO if: Has fewer papers or older publications

[If Q1 = NO, continue to Q4]
QUESTION 4: Does the research have ANY connection to the target direction?
- Answer YES if: The work uses related techniques or addresses related problems
- Answer NO if: Completely unrelated field

[If Q4 = YES, continue to Q5]
QUESTION 5: Does the professor have SOME publications showing this connection?
- Answer YES if: Has at least 1-2 papers showing relevance in 2020-2025
- Answer NO if: No clear evidence of relevant work

SCORING LOGIC (CRITICAL - Apply correctly):
- Q1=YES → Q2=YES → Q3=YES: Score 0.90-1.00 (Perfect Match)
- Q1=YES → Q2=YES → Q3=NO:  Score 0.75-0.89 (Strong Match)
- Q1=YES → Q2=NO:           Score 0.60-0.74 (Good Match)
- Q1=NO → Q4=YES → Q5=YES:  Score 0.40-0.59 (Moderate Match)
- Q1=NO → Q4=YES → Q5=NO:   Score 0.20-0.39 (Weak Match)
- Q1=NO → Q4=NO:            Score 0.00-0.19 (No Match)

TASK 2: Generate a PRECISE research direction summary (30-50 words, English only).
Include:
- Specific research topics
- Key techniques or methods
- Application domains (if any)
- Important keywords in parentheses

Example: "Physics-informed neural networks for fluid temperature reconstruction, real-time fluid simulation optimization, crowd simulation and physics simulation acceleration (recurrent neural networks, fluid carving, linear octree structures, motion capture)"
