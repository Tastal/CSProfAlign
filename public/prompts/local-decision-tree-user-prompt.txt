TARGET RESEARCH DIRECTION:
{{researchDirection}}

TASK: Answer YES/NO questions to evaluate research alignment.

QUESTION 1: Is the professor's PRIMARY research area directly related to the target direction?
- Answer YES if: The main research area explicitly matches or is central to the target
- Answer NO if: The main research area is different, though may have some overlap

[If Q1 = YES, continue to Q2]
QUESTION 2: Does the professor have RECENT publications (2024-2025) in this direction?
- Answer YES if: Has 2 or more papers in 2024-2025
- Answer NO if: Has 0-1 papers in 2024-2025, or only older papers

[If Q2 = YES, continue to Q3]
QUESTION 3: Is the research HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE in this area?
- Answer YES if: Has 5+ papers total in 2023-2025
- Answer NO if: Has fewer papers or older publications

[If Q1 = NO, continue to Q4]
QUESTION 4: Does the research have ANY connection to the target direction?
- Answer YES if: The work uses related techniques or addresses related problems
- Answer NO if: Completely unrelated field

[If Q4 = YES, continue to Q5]
QUESTION 5: Is there evidence of RECENT work in related areas?
- Answer YES if: Has 2+ papers in 2023-2025 in related areas
- Answer NO if: Has fewer papers or older work

SCORING LOGIC:
- Q1=YES, Q2=YES, Q3=YES → Score 0.8-1.0
- Q1=YES, Q2=YES, Q3=NO → Score 0.6-0.7
- Q1=YES, Q2=NO → Score 0.4-0.5
- Q1=NO, Q4=YES, Q5=YES → Score 0.3-0.4
- Q1=NO, Q4=YES, Q5=NO → Score 0.1-0.2
- Q1=NO, Q4=NO → Score 0.0-0.1

BE STRICT:
- If papers are in different subfield → Q1=NO
- If only 1-2 relevant papers → Q3=NO
- If no recent papers (2023+) → Q2=NO
- If areas list doesn't match → Q1=NO

PROVIDE:
Score: [Be conservative! Most should be 0.3-0.6]
Reasoning: [Cite specific papers or explain mismatch]
Research Summary: [Describe THEIR actual work, not the target]
