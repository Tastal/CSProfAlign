Target Research Direction:
{{researchDirection}}

TASK: Evaluate how well this professor's research aligns with the specified research direction.

Provide a match score between 0.0 and 1.0, where:
- 0.0-0.3: Poor match (different field or limited overlap)
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate match (some relevant work)
- 0.7-0.9: Good match (substantial alignment)
- 0.9-1.0: Excellent match (perfectly aligned, highly productive in this area)

IMPORTANT:
- Consider research area alignment, publication activity, and relevance
- Recent papers (2023-2025) should be weighted more heavily
- Use the FULL 0.0-1.0 scale - scores like 0.45, 0.55, 0.65 are valid
- Be nuanced in your scoring - not everything is either 0.2 or 0.8

REQUIRED OUTPUT (JSON only):
{
  "score": 0.XX,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation (max 100 words)",
  "research_summary": "Precise 30-50 word research direction summary with specific techniques and applications"
}
